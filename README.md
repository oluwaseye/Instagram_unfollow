# Instagram Unfollow Script

## About
This Javascript snippet automatically unfollows everyone in your Instagram account. It is designed to be used in the Javascript browser console - just copy/paste it (while you are logged into your Instagram account - you have to be on the profile page) and that's it.

## Usage
I. Log into your Instagram account
II. Go to your Profile page
III. Open the "Following" dialog (by clicking on the line that says "NNN following" - where "NNN" is the number of the people you are following at the moment)
IV. Open browser's developer tools (hit F12 - for Google Chrome and Firefox) and click on the "Console" tab
V. Copy/paste this Javascript snippet to the "Console" dialog in the browser
